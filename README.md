# github-basics-template
The template repository used to learn a little more about GitHub and GitHub classroom.

In order to finish the first recitation assignment, we need:

1. Create a fork of this repository using GitHub Classroom
1. Clone our forked repo to a workspace where we can code
1. Create a new file in the repo called `color.txt` that contains our favorite color
1. Make a new commit that adds this file to the repo
1. Push the new commit back to GitHub
